1. Project Overview
This project aims to create a dynamic and visually appealing web application that showcases famous singers using an interactive sliding carousel. Built with modern web technologies, the application will provide a smooth user experience on various devices, allowing users to browse through singer profiles and access their Wikipedia pages with a simple click.

2. Core Functionality
The application's primary purpose revolves around a responsive image carousel that acts as a "sliding window" of famous singers.

Display Singers: The carousel will present a series of slides, with each slide dedicated to a single famous singer.

Visual Information: Each slide will prominently feature an image of the singer, along with their name and a brief descriptive title.

Interactive Navigation: Users will be able to navigate through the carousel using standard controls (e.g., next/previous arrows, indicators).

External Linking: The core interactive feature is that each entire carousel slide will be clickable. When a user clicks on a slide, they will be redirected to that specific singer's Wikipedia page in a new browser tab.

Hover Feedback: To enhance user experience, a subtle visual cue will appear when a user hovers their mouse over a carousel slide. This cue will clearly indicate that the slide is clickable and will lead to an external link.

3. Technical Stack
We'll use a robust and popular set of technologies for building this application:

React (JavaScript Library): This is the foundation of our user interface. React allows us to build the application using reusable components, making the codebase organized and efficient.

TypeScript (Language): We'll use TypeScript to add static typing to our JavaScript code. This helps catch errors early, improves code readability, and makes the project easier to maintain, especially as it grows.

react-bootstrap (UI Library for React): Instead of directly using Bootstrap's raw CSS and JavaScript, we'll leverage react-bootstrap. This library provides Bootstrap's components (like the Carousel) as native React components, meaning they integrate seamlessly with React's lifecycle and state management, without relying on jQuery. This significantly simplifies UI development and ensures consistency.

Bootstrap CSS (Styling Framework): The underlying CSS of Bootstrap will provide the core styling, responsive grid system, and pre-built utility classes, ensuring our application looks good and adapts well to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) right out of the box.

4. Key Components
To build this application, we'll break it down into logical, reusable React components:

App.tsx (Main Application Component): This will be the top-level component that renders our entire application. It will likely contain the main layout elements, such as a container for the carousel.

SingerCarousel.tsx (Carousel Component): This is the heart of the application. This component will encapsulate the react-bootstrap Carousel logic. It will be responsible for:

Receiving the list of singers as a prop.

Iterating through the singers data to create individual carousel slides.

Handling the interactive linking and hover effects for each slide.

SingerData Interface (TypeScript Definition): A TypeScript interface will define the exact structure of data for each singer. This ensures consistency and type-safety throughout the application.



5. Implementation Details & Flow
Project Setup: We'll start by creating a new React project with TypeScript and installing the react-bootstrap and bootstrap npm packages. The core Bootstrap CSS will be imported once into index.tsx.

Data Management: The singers data array will be defined (either directly in a component or in a separate data file) and then passed down as a prop to the SingerCarousel component.

Carousel Rendering:

The SingerCarousel component will use the Carousel component from react-bootstrap.

It will map over the singers array, rendering a Carousel.Item for each singer.

Inside each Carousel.Item, an <img> tag will display the singer's image using imageUrl.

A Carousel.Caption component will display the name and title.

Clickable Slides:

To make the entire slide clickable, we'll likely wrap the content of each Carousel.Item in an <a> tag, setting its href to singer.wikipediaUrl and target="_blank" to open in a new tab.

Alternatively, we could attach an onClick handler to the Carousel.Item's content (e.g., a div) and use window.open(singer.wikipediaUrl, '_blank').

Hover Effect: Custom CSS will be applied to the carousel items (or a specific inner element) to change their appearance on hover. This might involve:

Changing the cursor to pointer.

Adding a subtle border or box-shadow.

Applying a slight overlay or transformation to indicate interactivity.

6. Future Enhancements (Beyond this Specification)
While not part of the initial core specification, potential future enhancements could include:

Adding a search bar to filter singers.

Implementing a "Read More" button on the caption that expands a short bio.

Fetching singer data from an external API instead of a local array.

Adding accessibility features (e.g., keyboard navigation for the carousel).

Allowing users to customize the carousel's autoplay speed or navigation.
